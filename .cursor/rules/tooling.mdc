# Tooling Rules

- **Always use Bun** as the script runner and package manager.
- Run installs with `bun install` (not `npm install`, `yarn`, or `pnpm`).
- Run scripts with `bun run <script>` or `bun <script>` (e.g. `bun run dev`, `bun test`).
- In documentation, terminal examples, and CI, use `bun` commands.
